The patient, Kate, a preterm infant at 32 weeks and 1 day post-conceptual age, 3.01kg, exhibited persistent bradycardia, with heart rates consistently below the normal range of 141–171 bpm, ranging from 113 bpm to 150 bpm. Respiratory distress was evident, as respiratory rates fluctuated significantly, frequently exceeding the normal upper limit of 70 breaths per minute, reaching a maximum of 102 breaths per minute, indicative of recurrent tachypnea. Additionally, there were instances of bradypnea, with respiratory rates dropping to as low as 28 breaths per minute. Body temperature remained largely within normal limits but occasionally exceeded the upper threshold of 37°C, suggesting intermittent hyperthermia. Pain levels varied throughout the shift, with several instances of moderate to high discomfort, requiring interventions such as swaddling and non-nutritive sucking. Other interventions included scheduled diaper changes, position adjustments (supine, lateral), and increased oxygen flow. The patient remained hemodynamically unstable, with considerable fluctuations in vital signs, warranting close monitoring and further evaluation.
