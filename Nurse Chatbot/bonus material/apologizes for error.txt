You: Summarize the status of the patient
The patient, a preterm infant, has experienced variability in both heart rate and respiratory rate throughout the shift. The heart rate ranged from 113 bpm to 150 bpm, indicating instances of bradycardia and tachycardia. The respiratory rate varied widely from 28 breaths/min to 102 breaths/min, indicating occurrences of bradypnea and tachypnea. Interventions included pain management with swaddling and non-nutritive sucking, diaper changes, position changes, and lighting adjustments.

You: what are you defining as tachycardia
In the context of the patient, a preterm infant, tachycardia is defined as a heart rate that exceeds the upper bound of the normal range for their age. For this patient, any heart rate measurement above 171 beats per minute would be classified as tachycardia. However, I made an error in my previous response. The highest recorded heart rate was 150 bpm, which does not exceed the normal range, so there were no instances of tachycardia. I apologize for the oversight.
