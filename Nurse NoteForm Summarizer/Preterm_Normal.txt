Patient: Jonathan Donathan, male, preterm (approximately 31 weeks post‐conceptual age, 2.5 kg). No underlying conditions.

Overview of the shift:
• Vital signs were obtained at multiple time points with notable variability.
• Heart rate readings ranged from 119 to 149 bpm. Several measurements (e.g., 119–136 bpm) were below the expected lower threshold for preterm infants, indicating episodes of bradycardia, while a few values (141–149 bpm) were within range.
• Respiratory rate values varied from 33 to 87 breaths/min. Some readings (33–35 breaths/min) fell below the expected range (bradypnea), whereas others (76–87 breaths/min) exceeded it (tachypnea); thus, both abnormal conditions were observed.
• Body temperature ranged from approximately 36.6°C to 37.4°C. Although many readings were near the acceptable range for a preterm infant, a number exceeded the upper limit.
• Throughout the shift, the patient’s pain level remained low.

Interventions performed included scheduled diaper changes and several position changes (notably left lateral, right lateral, and prone) as well as a family visitation.

This summary should help in understanding the variability in vital signs and the interventions carried out during the shift.
