Patient Jane Doe is a 17‐day-old, 3.8‑kg female in the NICU. Throughout the shift, her heart rate readings consistently ranged between 68 and 80 bpm—which is uniformly below the expected range for neonates, confirming documented bradycardia. Her respiratory rate, however, fluctuated between 39 and 95 breaths per minute; while several measurements fell within the normal range, many were elevated beyond the upper limit, resulting in a variable respiratory pattern without a uniform abnormal classification. Body temperatures remained stable, ranging from approximately 36.5°C to 37.4°C. Interventions performed during the shift included scheduled diaper changes and several position changes (noted as right lateral, supine, and left lateral). Pain levels remained low at all recorded time points. Please continue close monitoring, particularly of her heart rate and variable respiratory pattern, and follow up with any protocol-specific adjustments as needed.
